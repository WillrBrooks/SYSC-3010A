Lab 3

This directory contains the files relevant to SYSC 3010 Lab 3.  This lab 
serves as an introduction to SQLite databases.  It will also aid in becoming 
more familiar with the JSON format.

**note that no new database was created for exercise 2.  Instead the existing
database from exercise 1 was used.
